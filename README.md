# GREEN STREET
## A Front Yard Market Revolution
Green Street is dedicated to solving the complex crisis of food deserts around the world by thinking small. If every city block had a collection of backyard gardeners growing fresh fruits, vegetables, honey and eggs, access to fresh food would be everywhere. Green Street provides the network and space to establish connections between gardeners and the neighbors that surround them. Front yard markets provide a community with fresh food, economic opportunity and a strong social structure. Front yard markets provide a safe space for neighbors to interact and share ideas and for families to see where their food comes from. We believe in these values. If you do too, please search for a Green Street market in your neighborhood or JOIN Green Street and start a revolution today.

## Technologies used for this app:
  1. React
  2. Express, Node.js
  3. MongoDB, Mongoose
  4. Bootstrap,CSS 
  5. Google Maps API, Google Geocoding
  6. Bcryptjs: used to hash passwords before we store them in our database
  7. Body-parser: used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware
  8. Concurrently: allows us to run our backend and frontend concurrently and on different ports
  9. is-empty: global function that will come in handy when we use validator
  10. jsonwebtoken: used for authorization
  11. passport: used to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies
  12. passport-jwt: passport strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token (JWT); lets you authenticate endpoints using a JWT
  13. validator: used to validate inputs (e.g. check for valid email format, confirming passwords match)
  14. axios: promise based HTTP client for making requests to our backend
  15. classnames: used for conditional classes in our JSX
  16. jwt-decode: used to decode our jwt so we can get user data from it
  17. react-redux: allows us to use Redux with React
  18. react-router-dom: used for routing purposes
  19. redux: used to manage state between components (can be used with React or any other view library)
  20. redux-thunk: middleware for Redux that allows us to directly access the dispatch method to make asynchronous calls from our actions
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
